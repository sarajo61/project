This book explains one of the most popular investment strategies today and one that works in employer-sponsored retirement accounts and accounts you run on your own: index funds.
Bogle believes that low-cost index funds are by far the best option for investors and leans on the authors mentioned above to prove his case. But his theories go beyond those of academia. Bogle is the founder and retired CEO of Vanguard, an investment management firm with over $5 trillion under management. He knows what he’s talking about.
